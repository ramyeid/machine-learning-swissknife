*** UI - Swing ***
- Find a way to create an abstract view (Configuration (abstract), Applier (abstract))
=> so we don't have to create the same frame multiple times (we add the applier needed and the configuration needed)
and the code that handle the screen is shared.
- rearrange the way tryPopup => message and title and stack ?
- rework ui => refactor write tests
- maybe call the forecast / predict in another thread and update the screen in another thread. ? (but what if they launch multiple request ? )
    => grey the other buttons?

*** UI - Web ***
- Final Step make the application a web application as well.

**todo**

Create yml file to explain all end points of all components.
